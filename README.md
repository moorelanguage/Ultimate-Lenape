## Heading
[Lenape Talking Dictionary](talk-lenape.org), abbreviated as LTD, The ultimate Lenape dictionary for the Southern Unami dialect. Created by the Delaware Tribe of Indians in Bartlesville with the project director being Jim Rementer. It has over 17k words. I started here!  

[Mukurtu-Midwest](https://mukurtu-midwest.org/dictionary) A large public dictionary for the Munsee dialect (over 1k words), also features other languages including 14 words in the Mohican langauge. This is cool because there is a tribe that has both Munsee Lenape and Mohicans, the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians! There is a community page of mukurtu that has a Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans community for members of that tribe. 

[Wiktionary Unami](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Unami_language) Mainly using the LTD as a source but also has some etymologies which is awesome. However it features Unami as a seperate language rather than a dialect.

[Wiktionary Munsee](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Munsee_language) does feature Munsee as a seperate language than Unami rather than a dialect of the same Lenape. It is awesome becuase it uses the O'Meara dictionary as a source, which is a physical out of print dictionary that costs money. It doesn't digitize every word in the dictionary but could be useful for those who can't afford the O'Meara dictionary!

[1888](https://ia600206.us.archive.org/15/items/lenpenglishd00brin/lenpenglishd00brin.pdf) An online Lenape-English dictionary in Unami from 1888! This is an awesome find on archive.org and has words not on other dictionaries like the LTD. I titled this 1888 after how on the LTD Historical Examples in words they usually put the year next to the word. [example](https://www.talk-lenape.org/detail?id=9992): Terren [1633]. Speaking of 1633...

[1633](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_xLF8OiAonjIC) this is the Latin edition of a book published in 1633 with words that are either Lenape or the Jargon (Delaware Pidgin) langauge. This is the same work mentioned in the [LTD Historical Examples page](https://www.talk-lenape.org/historical-examples) and it was a truly awesome find on archive.org for me that I have been dying to share It is truly awesome and amazing. The wordlist starts on page 131 in the downloaded edition of this archive.org pdf. It took some time for me to find the page myself so I am making it easier for you all lovely folks!

[Raymond Whritenour's Academdia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/RaymondWhritenour) Whritenour is an awesome linguist who has has done extensive work with the Lenape Language! As of right now his academia.edu page has 31 Books, 1 Talks, 26 Papers, 1 Conference Presentations, 9 book reviews and, 3 drafts. He has word lists, a grammar guide, and more! 

[James Rementer's Academia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/JamesRementer) the Academia.edu page of the awesome linguist who is the project director of the LTD. 

## Flashcards 

[vaia](https://app.vaia.com/studyset/10286672?ref=btXkep8f8okuKEuiyPfbFto0lP4aG14E&ref_type=studyset_share) a flashcard set made in 2023 by a student of the [Shelly Depaul Language Course](https://6abc.com/post/lenape-teach-language-indigenous-people-of-pennsylvania-teaching-class/12482441/). I manually imported this into anki, but there is no built in way to export a deck from Vaia to Anki. Maybe I'll host my local anki  version that probably has a mistake or two here if anyone is interested. This is for the Southern Unami Dialect.

[tabetha_super quizlets](https://quizlet.com/user/tabetha_super/sets) various decks on this quizlet for the Lenape language, most likely another Shelly Depaul student. This is for the Southern Unami Dialect.
