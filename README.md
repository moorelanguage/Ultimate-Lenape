# Ultimate Lenape Language List
TLDR: The Ultimate List for the Lenape language.

This is a list for everything related to the Lenape language to help people of all levels in the language: people who are curious, beginners, teachers, etc. I got inspired by a "The Coding Sloth" video and got inspired by the Awesome List(s) mentioned in said video. That inspiration led me to create my own ultimate list with all of the information and sources for the Lenape Language that I have spent countless hours and hours researching over the course of my journey with this language.

## Heading
[Lenape Talking Dictionary](talk-lenape.org), abbreviated as LTD, The ultimate Lenape dictionary for the Southern Unami dialect. Created by the Delaware Tribe of Indians in Bartlesville with the project director being Jim Rementer. It has over 17k words. I started here!  

[Mukurtu-Midwest](https://mukurtu-midwest.org/dictionary) A large public dictionary for the Munsee dialect (over 1k words), also features other languages including 14 words in the Mohican langauge. This is cool because there is a tribe that has both Munsee Lenape and Mohicans, the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians! There is a community page of mukurtu that has a Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans community for members of that tribe. 

[Wiktionary Unami](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Unami_language) Mainly using the LTD as a source but also has some etymologies which is awesome. However it features Unami as a seperate language rather than a dialect.

[Wiktionary Munsee](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Munsee_language) does feature Munsee as a seperate language than Unami rather than a dialect of the same Lenape. It is awesome becuase it uses the O'Meara dictionary as a source, which is a physical out of print dictionary that costs money. It doesn't digitize every word in the dictionary but could be useful for those who can't afford the O'Meara dictionary!

[1888](https://ia600206.us.archive.org/15/items/lenpenglishd00brin/lenpenglishd00brin.pdf) An online Lenape-English dictionary in Unami from 1888! This is an awesome find on archive.org and has words not on other dictionaries like the LTD. I titled this 1888 after how on the LTD Historical Examples in words they usually put the year next to the word. [example](https://www.talk-lenape.org/detail?id=9992): Terren [1633]. Speaking of 1633...

[1633](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_xLF8OiAonjIC) this is the Latin edition of a book published in 1633 with words that are either Lenape or the Jargon (Delaware Pidgin) langauge. This is the same work mentioned in the [LTD Historical Examples page](https://www.talk-lenape.org/historical-examples) and it was a truly awesome find on archive.org for me that I have been dying to share It is truly awesome and amazing. The wordlist starts on page 131 in the downloaded edition of this archive.org pdf. It took some time for me to find the page myself so I am making it easier for you all lovely folks!

[Raymond Whritenour's Academdia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/RaymondWhritenour) Whritenour is an awesome linguist who has has done extensive work with the Lenape Language! As of right now his academia.edu page has 31 Books, 1 Talks, 26 Papers, 1 Conference Presentations, 9 book reviews and, 3 drafts. He has word lists, a grammar guide, and more! 

[James Rementer's Academia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/JamesRementer) the Academia.edu page of the awesome linguist who is the project director of the LTD. 

[Gilwell](https://www.gilwell.com/lenape) another public online dictionary for Lenape! Appears to use 1888 as the source, I don't think it copies all words from that book however and leaves some words and meanings from the book out.

[Evolpub](http://www.evolpub.com/) publishes some Lenape wordlists! Has a public repository of their ebooks for people. The books relevant to Lenape is "Vol._03_Unami_Jargon", "Vol._05_NJ_Jargon", "Vol._10_NJ_Delaware", "Vol._12_Delaware", "Vol._15_Delaware", "Vol._29_Minsi". The books I list here are for a variety of dialects and the jargon/pidign language that stemmed from the unami dialect of Lenape. They also have other languages. 

## Flashcards 

[vaia](https://app.vaia.com/studyset/10286672?ref=btXkep8f8okuKEuiyPfbFto0lP4aG14E&ref_type=studyset_share) a flashcard set made in 2023 by a student of the [Shelly Depaul Language Course](https://6abc.com/post/lenape-teach-language-indigenous-people-of-pennsylvania-teaching-class/12482441/). I manually imported this into anki, but there is no built in way to export a deck from Vaia to Anki. Maybe I'll host my local anki  version that probably has a mistake or two here if anyone is interested. This is for the Southern Unami Dialect.

[tabetha_super quizlets](https://quizlet.com/user/tabetha_super/sets) various decks on this quizlet for the Lenape language, most likely another Shelly Depaul student. This is for the Southern Unami Dialect.


## Course 
[Shelly Depaul Language Course](https://6abc.com/post/lenape-teach-language-indigenous-people-of-pennsylvania-teaching-class/12482441/) this is a news article that goes over this awesome course with her email at the end to reachout to Depaul. This class is done over Zoom for free, with the textbook being the only cost. 

[Student Projects](https://www1.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/Linguistics/LenapeLanguageResources/student.html) Public student projects from when the class was taught at swarthmore college in PA. 

## Apps 
[helleniechsin](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helleniechsin/id432595183) old boy scouts app that is a dictionary for the Lenape language, uses 1888 as a source. Linked app on apple store but also is available for the kindle fire. From my use on the kindle fire it is really old and I am unable to see how many words were on here or how complete it is, according to twitter I'd hazard a guess that development was last done in 2013. If anyone was able to get this to work that would be awesome! As far as I'm aware this is the first public mobile app for the language. 

[Lenape Vocab Builder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.endangeredlanguages.lenapevb2&hl=en_US) I noticed this app pop up in late 2025 and appears to be partnered with a Lenape Tribe in Oklahoma as judging by the logo, made with the language conservatory. This is very awesome that this is an app being made!! Also available on [ipad](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/lenape-vocab-builder/id6747041606) apparently, but I don't have an apple device so I can't test it to make sure. It currently has 10+ downloads, with me being one of them. I did share this with my classmates when I saw this! Currently unfinshed and has some "test" entries still. This is the second public app for the language. 
 
## Other
[Common Script/ Lenee Mamalekheekun](https://bighornlenape.com/common-script-lenee-mamalekheekun-t198.html) A apparent script for Lenape. I have made my own font based off of this I can also host on github and link here if anyone is interested with a guide. This is not really used anywhere else, including other spots on this site. This is awesome because I used to think that there were not writing systems for Lenape besides the one's made by linguists, so this is really cool.
