## Heading
[Lenape Talking Dictionary](talk-lenape.org), abbreviated as LTD, The ultimate Lenape dictionary for the Southern Unami dialect. Created by the Delaware Tribe of Indians in Bartlesville with the project director being Jim Rementer. It has over 17k words. I started here!  

[Mukurtu-Midwest](https://mukurtu-midwest.org/dictionary) A large public dictionary for the Munsee dialect (over 1k words), also features other languages including 14 words in the Mohican langauge. This is cool because there is a tribe that has both Munsee Lenape and Mohicans, the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians! There is a community page of mukurtu that has a Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans community for members of that tribe. 

[Wiktionary Unami](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Unami_language) Mainly using the LTD as a source but also has some etymologies which is awesome. However it features Unami as a seperate language rather than a dialect.

[Wiktionary Munsee](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Munsee_language) does feature Munsee as a seperate language than Unami rather than a dialect of the same Lenape. It is awesome becuase it uses the O'Meara dictionary as a source, which is a physical out of print dictionary that costs money. It doesn't digitize every word in the dictionary but could be useful for those who can't afford the O'Meara dictionary!

[Raymond Whritenour's Academdia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/RaymondWhritenour) Whritenour is an awesome linguist who has has done extensive work with the Lenape Language! As of right now his academia.edu page has 31 Books, 1 Talks, 26 Papers, 1 Conference Presentations, 9 book reviews and, 3 drafts. He has word lists, a grammar guide, and more! 

[James Rementer's Academia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/JamesRementer) the Academia.edu page of the awesome linguist who is the project director of the LTD.
