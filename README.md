# Ultimate Lenape Language List
TLDR: The Ultimate List for the Lenape language.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
Last update: 3:50 AM 2025-12-04, this README and making this list public, and added changelog. 

This is a list for everything related to the Lenape language to help people of all levels in the language: people who are curious, beginners, teachers, etc. I got inspired by a "The Coding Sloth" video and got inspired by the Awesome List(s) mentioned in said video. That inspiration led me to create my own ultimate list with all of the information and sources for the Lenape Language that I have spent countless hours and hours researching over the course of my journey with this language.

## Wordlists and Readings 
[Lenape Talking Dictionary](talk-lenape.org), abbreviated as LTD, The ultimate Lenape dictionary for the Southern Unami dialect. Created by the Delaware Tribe of Indians in Bartlesville with the project director being Jim Rementer. It has over 17k words. I started here!  

[Mukurtu-Midwest](https://mukurtu-midwest.org/dictionary) A large public dictionary for the Munsee dialect (over 1k words), also features other languages including 14 words in the Mohican langauge. This is cool because there is a tribe that has both Munsee Lenape and Mohicans, the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians! There is a community page of mukurtu that has a Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans community for members of that tribe. 

[Wiktionary Unami](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Unami_language) Mainly using the LTD as a source but also has some etymologies which is awesome. However it features Unami as a seperate language rather than a dialect.

[Wiktionary Munsee](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Munsee_language) does feature Munsee as a seperate language than Unami rather than a dialect of the same Lenape. It is awesome becuase it uses the O'Meara dictionary as a source, which is a physical out of print dictionary that costs money. It doesn't digitize every word in the dictionary but could be useful for those who can't afford the O'Meara dictionary!

[1888](https://ia600206.us.archive.org/15/items/lenpenglishd00brin/lenpenglishd00brin.pdf) An online Lenape-English dictionary in Unami from 1888! This is an awesome find on archive.org and has words not on other dictionaries like the LTD. I titled this 1888 after how on the LTD Historical Examples in words they usually put the year next to the word. [example](https://www.talk-lenape.org/detail?id=9992): Terren [1633]. Speaking of 1633...

[1633](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_xLF8OiAonjIC) this is the Latin edition of a book published in 1633 with words that are either Lenape or the Jargon (Delaware Pidgin) langauge. This is the same work mentioned in the [LTD Historical Examples page](https://www.talk-lenape.org/historical-examples) and it was a truly awesome find on archive.org for me that I have been dying to share It is truly awesome and amazing. The wordlist starts on page 131 in the downloaded edition of this archive.org pdf. It took some time for me to find the page myself so I am making it easier for you all lovely folks!

[Raymond Whritenour's Academdia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/RaymondWhritenour) Whritenour is an awesome linguist who has has done extensive work with the Lenape Language! As of right now his academia.edu page has 31 Books, 1 Talks, 26 Papers, 1 Conference Presentations, 9 book reviews and, 3 drafts. He has word lists, a grammar guide, and more! 

[James Rementer's Academia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/JamesRementer) the Academia.edu page of the awesome linguist who is the project director of the LTD. 

[Gilwell](https://www.gilwell.com/lenape) another public online dictionary for Lenape! Appears to use 1888 as the source, I don't think it copies all words from that book however and leaves some words and meanings from the book out.

[Evolpub](http://www.evolpub.com/) publishes some Lenape wordlists! Has a public repository of their ebooks for people. The books relevant to Lenape is "Vol._03_Unami_Jargon", "Vol._05_NJ_Jargon", "Vol._10_NJ_Delaware", "Vol._12_Delaware", "Vol._15_Delaware", "Vol._29_Minsi". The books I list here are for a variety of dialects and the jargon/pidign language that stemmed from the unami dialect of Lenape. They also have other languages. 

## Flashcards 

[vaia](https://app.vaia.com/studyset/10286672?ref=btXkep8f8okuKEuiyPfbFto0lP4aG14E&ref_type=studyset_share) a flashcard set made in 2023 by a student of the [Shelly Depaul Language Course](https://6abc.com/post/lenape-teach-language-indigenous-people-of-pennsylvania-teaching-class/12482441/). I manually imported this into anki, but there is no built in way to export a deck from Vaia to Anki. Maybe I'll host my local anki  version that probably has a mistake or two here if anyone is interested. This is for the Southern Unami Dialect.

[tabetha_super quizlets](https://quizlet.com/user/tabetha_super/sets) various decks on this quizlet for the Lenape language, most likely another Shelly Depaul student. This is for the Southern Unami Dialect.

[nicky_michea14 quizlets](https://quizlet.com/user/nicky_michael4/sets) various decks on this quizlet for the Lenape language, some of them have different themes like "Kahèsëna Hàki Mother Earth Flashcards". Decks appear to be Southern Unami dialect, at the very least "Kahèsëna Hàki Mother Earth Flashcards" is. 

[Beginner Lunaape Language Workshop Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/592494327/beginner-lunaape-language-workshop-flash-cards/) A Munsee dialect flash card deck on quizlet, the flash cards source to quote the description "Sources: The HHS Beginner Lunaape Language Workshop and YouTube Lenape Language with Karen Mosko (https://youtu.be/j-bsgK5f1yM)" 

[fxdpfmc54t quizlet](https://quizlet.com/user/fxdpfmc54t/sets) has animal and body quizlets for the lenape language. 


## Courses 
[Shelly Depaul Language Course](https://6abc.com/post/lenape-teach-language-indigenous-people-of-pennsylvania-teaching-class/12482441/) this is a news article that goes over this awesome course with her email at the end to reachout to Depaul. This class is done over Zoom for free, with the textbook being the only cost. 

[Student Projects](https://www1.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/Linguistics/LenapeLanguageResources/student.html) Public student projects from when the class was taught at swarthmore college in PA. 

[The HHS Beginner Lunaape Language Workshop and YouTube Lenape Language with Karen Mosko](https://youtu.be/j-bsgK5f1yM) I haven't watched this yet but this is linked in a quizlet above and appears to be a Munsee dialect one off workshop. 

[Big Horn Forum Lessons](https://bighornlenape.com/lenape-language-f15/) this forum has a series of lessons that teaches the Northern Unami dialect, specifically the Big Horn Lenape dialect.

## Apps 
[helleniechsin](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/helleniechsin/id432595183) old boy scouts app that is a dictionary for the Lenape language, uses 1888 as a source. Linked app on apple store but also is available for the kindle fire. From my use on the kindle fire it is really old and I am unable to see how many words were on here or how complete it is, according to twitter I'd hazard a guess that development was last done in 2013. If anyone was able to get this to work that would be awesome! As far as I'm aware this is the first public mobile app for the language. 

[Lenape Vocab Builder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.endangeredlanguages.lenapevb2&hl=en_US) I noticed this app pop up in late 2025 and appears to be partnered with a Lenape Tribe in Oklahoma as judging by the logo, made with the language conservatory. This is very awesome that this is an app being made!! Also available on [ipad](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/lenape-vocab-builder/id6747041606) apparently, but I don't have an apple device so I can't test it to make sure. It currently has 10+ downloads, with me being one of them. I did share this with my classmates when I saw this! Currently unfinshed and has some "test" entries still. This is the second public app for the language. 
 
## Articles 

[Shelly Depaul Language Course](https://6abc.com/post/lenape-teach-language-indigenous-people-of-pennsylvania-teaching-class/12482441/) this is a news article that goes over this awesome course with her email at the end to reachout to Depaul. This class is done over Zoom for free, with the textbook being the only cost. 

[Penn student co-creates AI-translator to spread awareness about Lenape language, history](https://www.thedp.com/article/2023/11/student-creates-ai-translator-to-share-lenape-culture) an article about an AI Lenape project, specifically to aim as a translator for Lenape. Here's the link to the app directly [Lenalingua](https://lenalingua.streamlit.app/). I asked it as a test "could you translate I am tired into Lenape" (it asked what language when i left out "Lenape") and the AI chatbot responded "Response: In Lenape, "I am tired" can be translated as "Ntëmëw.""  which is not correct for any dialect as far as I know. Newikihela would be the correct answer I was looking for. It appears that it does actually have some sort of basis on Lenape, as teme is a lenape word meaning wolf and the "nt" pattern is found in various words meaning "I am", so that's actually pretty decent in my opinion. This project appears to be from 2023 and to test it I had to "wake" it up, so keep that in mind. It is noble to develop technology for the language, props to this person. 

[Putting the fourth crow in the sky: Using narrative to understand the experiences of one non-heritage learner of an endangered language.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277145407_Putting_the_fourth_crow_in_the_sky_Using_narrative_to_understand_the_experiences_of_one_non-heritage_learner_of_an_endangered_language) research paper on the Lenape Language, specifically the author Miranda Weinberg writes about learning the Lenape Language as a non-heritage learner.

## Other
[Common Script/ Lenee Mamalekheekun](https://bighornlenape.com/common-script-lenee-mamalekheekun-t198.html) A apparent script for Lenape. I have made my own font based off of this I can also host on github and link here if anyone is interested with a guide. This is not really used anywhere else, including other spots on this site. This is awesome because I used to think that there were not writing systems for Lenape besides the one's made by linguists, so this is really cool.
